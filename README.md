# ti-draft-tool

This started as a direct copy of Milty draft tool.  The goal is to have a poor-man's multi-user draft.  I just added ability to force random seed and I hard coded the people in my draft.  I just edit these hard coded values for new drafts.  

In practice, we group text our picks, then everyone has to enter each pick into their page.
